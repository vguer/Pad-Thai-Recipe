          <p>Vanessa once traveled to to Thailand looking for the famous Penang Curry she regularly ordered from her favorite Thai restaurant. Little did she know, Penang is in Malaysia. A trip that was supposed to center around curry gifted her the opportunity to eat pad thai to her heart's content. This recipe is nothing like the pad thai she had in Thailand, it's far worse, in fact. You've now been warned and can (and should) proceed.</p>
