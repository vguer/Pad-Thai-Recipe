          <p>Vanessa once traveled to to Thailand looking for the famous Penang Curry she regularly ordered from her favorite Thai restaurant. Little did she know, Penang is in Malaysia. A trip that was supposed to center around curry gifted her the opportunity to eat pad thai to her heart's content.
